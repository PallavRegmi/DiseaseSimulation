### **Roles for each members of the project**

### Pallav Regmi: Core Simulation Logic
- **Designs the agent behaviors and state transitions** (Vulnerable, Sick, Immune, Dead).
- **Implements the simulation's core logic**, including disease spread mechanisms and agent interactions.
- **Handles concurrency and synchronization** to manage agents running on separate threads safely.

### Ashmit Agrawal: GUI and Configuration
- **Develops the GUI** to display the simulation, showing agents in different states and providing user control over the simulation (start, stop, restart).
- **Manages the configuration file** loading and parsing, applying settings to the simulation.
- **Implements additional features**, such as simulation history, plotting disease progression, or agent movement.

### Collaborative Efforts:
- **Integration and Testing**: Both members work together to integrate the core logic with the GUI, ensuring the simulation runs as intended and is accurately represented visually.
- **Documentation**: Jointly document the project, detailing setup, operation, and features.
- **Feedback and Refinement**: Share feedback on each otherâ€™s work for improvement and refinement, addressing any bugs or performance issues found during testing.
